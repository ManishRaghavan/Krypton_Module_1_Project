            <p>"We learned about Inspectlet from our<br>
                friends at Mogl.<strong>They raved about<br>
                Inspectlet, and we understand why.</strong><br>
                On our site, we learned that some<br>
                people wanted to click on things that<br>
                didn't link anywhere and that others<br>
                were not clicking on things we wanted<br>
                them to click on.<strong>The tool is extremely<br>
                inexpensive but priceless.</strong>"
