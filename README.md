<h1>What the project does</h1>

<p>Inspectlet records videos of your visitors as they use your site, allowing you to see everything they do. See every mouse movement, scroll, click, and keypress on your site. You never need to wonder how visitors are using your site again.</p>

<h1>Why the project is useful</h1>

<h3>Eye-tracking Heatmaps.</h3>
<p> See where your visitors are looking and what parts of the site they're reading by visualizing their mouse movements. Research shows that mouse and eye movement are highly correlated.</p>

<h3>Scroll Heatmaps.</h3>
<p>Scroll heatmaps show you how far visitors are scrolling down on your site's pages. Find out how many people actually make it to the middle or bottom of the page. Learn where on your page to place your most important content, like the purchase button or a special discount banner.</p>
<h1>How users can get started with the project</h1>
<p>just drop a few lines of javascript into your site and you'll start seeing data in your dashboard instantly.</p>
